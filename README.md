  ### 👨‍🏫 Java Mentorship Program  
A structured learning program focused on real-world backend development using Java and Spring Boot.  
During this program, I built the [**Vacation Tracking System**](https://github.com/ahmedmostafa13/Vacation-Tracking-System), an enterprise-level internal app that handles employee vacation requests with the following features:

- Submit, edit, withdraw, and cancel vacation requests  
- Manager approval and HR overrides  
- Email notifications and request status tracking  
- RESTful Web Service API  
- SSO-based security and legacy HR system integration  
- Full technical documentation: ERD, Sequence Diagrams, Flowcharts, and Requirements specs  

This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of backend architecture, domain modeling, and enterprise-grade software design.
